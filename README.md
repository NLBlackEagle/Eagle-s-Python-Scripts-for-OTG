# Eagle's Handy OTG Scripts
I've created a handy little tool that will output relevant information on a preset to a single file. For example, if you want a list of biomes & the biomecolors they use you wont need to do this manually any longer. This will also display the mob spawning rules for each biome. This function can be found as script 1.

The second script is created for preset creators & makes it so that all virtual biomes inherit their virtual biome settings (Color, mobspawning, etc) from the inherited biome. This makes it so you can safely remove all virtual biomes.

The third script is to find duplicate biomecolors, very handy when E.G. making BBundle fromimage compatible.


# Eagle's Best (Bulk-Editor-Structure-Tool)

This tool does exactly as it says, it bulk edits .bo3 or .bo4 files for OpenTerrainGenerator. By executing the program the config & the output/input folders will be generated. The config should be self-explainatory.
